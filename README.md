# portfolio
My own stronghold. The site is currently undergoing a major reconstruction. 
You can visit my website here [https://kubakorniluk.pl/](https://kubakorniluk.pl/).

## Description
The main goal with this portfolio was to have an unique design that goes hand in hand with my own artistic style - futuristic minimalism. 
This also influenced the introduction of some unusual functionalities such as controlling the project gallery with the mouse wheel or not scrolling the page at all.
I really wanted this website to feel as an individual immersive experience to every user.<br/><br/>

But in the process of development I started to notice that the page is being more design focused, than useful and practical. 
That's why it will go through some major changes in the near future, which will mainly improve portoflio usability.

## Planned features
* Controlling the project gallery with swipe event on mobile devices
* Interactive cursor
* Better RWD
* Improved loading screen design
* Loading screen fade animation
* Sidebar animation
* Improved website performance

## Further development
* Main content (about, projects gallery, contact) will be placed on the home page
* Ability to scroll the website, better readability
* Freelance projects subpages & error pages
* Personal projects will be hosted on subdomains
* Blog (MERN stack)

## Technologies used
* ```React```
* ```React Router```
* ```styled-components```
* ```Webpack``` & ```Babel```
